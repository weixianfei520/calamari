Building Packages
=================

These guidelines are aimed at developers wishing to build RPM or .deb packages of Calamari.

Prerequisites:
 * git
 * Vagrant >= 1.3.5

calamari-server
---------------

::

    git clone https://github.com/ceph/calamari.git
    git clone https://github.com/ceph/Diamond.git --branch=calamari
    cd calamari/vagrant/precise-build
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh -c 'sudo salt-call state.highstate'


.. note::

    The ``precise-build`` vagrant configuration builds packages for Ubuntu 12.04.  There are other
    vagrant configurations in the same directory for other distributions.


calamari-clients
----------------

::

  git clone https://github.com/ceph/calamari-clients.git
  cd calamari-clients/vagrant/precise-build
  vagrant up
  vagrant ssh -c 'sudo salt-call state.highstate'

.. note::

    The ``precise-build`` vagrant configuration is the only one that actually builds the UI: the
    other configurations in this folder simply take the output from ``precise-build`` and repackage
    it for another distribution.

Build results
-------------

On a successful build, vagrant machines will output built packages in the parent directory
of the git repositories.  For example, having run all the above commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ls
    Diamond    # git clone of diamond
    calamari   # git clone of calamari (server)
    calamari-clients # git clone of calamari-clients
    calamari-clients-build-output.tar.gz    # unpackaged build of calamari-clients
    calamari-clients_1.2-rc2-47-g5f7c653_all.deb    # package for installation on calamari server
    calamari-repo-precise.tar.gz    # minion repository, see below
    calamari-server_1.2-rc2-58-gf3f7872_all.deb    # package for installation on calamari server
    diamond_3.4.67_all.deb    # diamond package for use on ceph servers

The minion repository tarball may come as a surprise; this is an optional component.  Untar
this in /opt/calamari/webapp/content after installing calamari-server, and the packages
contained in it will be served as an apt or yum repository by Calamari server.  This includes
salt-minion and diamond packages.  Using this repository is optional because you may also
choose to obtain these packages independently.

The calamari-clients-build-output.tar.gz file contains the built user interface in form
suitable for rebuilding as a package for other platforms, or for use in a development
environment.  This tarball is the same thing that is inside the calamari-clients-<version>.deb
package, but in a distro-agnostic form.

Finally, check your packages install correctly by following the installation
procedure: :doc:`/operations/server_install`

Troubleshooting
---------------

First a general note: while the vagrant environments are automatically provisioned
with salt during "vagrant up", this isn't foolproof.  If something seems wrong
or built packages are not seen in the directory above mentioned, try this:

.. code-block:: bash

  vagrant ssh
  sudo salt-call state.highstate

When you want to dig into the details of what these vagrant configurations are doing, go
look in the ``salt/`` subdirectory of each one to see what is being run on a ``highstate``.
