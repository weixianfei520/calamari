Calamari server tests
---------------------

These are end to end tests of the Calamari server as a black box, with
a Ceph cluster in one end and REST out the other.

Highlights:

- Using unittest2 (the variant bundled in django), because although not everything
  is a unit test, a library that runs functions and reports results is a handy thing.
- `nose` is a handy utility for finding and running tests

Assuming you've already got a nice development environment set up (such that
you can run Calamari services with supervisor without errors), you can execute
the server tests very simply:

.. code-block:: bash

    # set these values in the [testing] section of calamari/tests/test.conf
    calamari_control = embedded
    ceph_control = embedded 

.. code-block:: bash

    calamari $ nosetests tests/

Note that these take some time to execute: since these are not unit tests, they
incur lots of the real-life overheads of a full blown system, and some tests
incur walltime waits to exercise certain paths.

Testing against a converged ceph cluster
----------------------------------------

In this section we'll setup a variant of the tests where a Ceph MON and OSD are 
running on the same node as an instance of devmode Calamari.

Theory of operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This setup allows us to rapidly test the real interfaces of librados with different
versions of Ceph. It is not representitive of a supported deployment of Ceph since there
are no provisions for data durability if the MON or OSD crash much will be lost.

Step 0: Setup devmode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See :ref:`using-vagrant` for instructions.
Ceph will be automatically setup by initialiting a devmode vagrant.
Tests will automatically run as part of the provisioning process.

Testing against a real live ceph cluster
----------------------------------------

In :ref:`calamari-server-tests` we saw the test suite executing against a cluster simulator,

In this section we'll configure those same tests to run against a real cluster built
on teuthology.

Theory of operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will build a ceph cluster using the ceph-deploy task on teuthology. Teuthology is a framework that allocates
and provisions hardware for testing. ceph-deploy is a piece of software that simplifies setup
of ceph clusters. Once the cluster is up and reports healthy we will use our devmode instance of calamari to
execute the :ref:`calamari-server-tests`. Finally we will teardown the cluster.

Teuthology is typically used in a fashion that trades speed for isolation. Tasks that install packages are expected to
remove everything it installs. This can leave lab machines in an inconsistent state.
See :ref:`troubleshooting` below for a process to reimage machines.

Step 0: Setup SSH credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

get your ssh credentials into this environment and setup VPN
There are many ways to accomplish this and it is beyond the scope of this document

Test that you have a working step 0:

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh ubuntu@teuthology.front.sepia.ceph.com "echo 'it works'"

.. _building-the-cluster:

Step 1: Building the cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    # Please replace calamari@inktank.com with your email address
    cd /home/vagrant/teuthology
    source virtualenv/bin/activate
    rm -rf archive; teuthology --archive archive \
                    --lock \
                    --owner calamari@inktank.com \
                    --machine-type mira \
                    --description "calamari devmode test target" \
                    ~/calamari/dev/teuthology.yaml

If successful this will leave you in an interactive state. Which looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    Ceph test interactive mode, use ctx to interact with the cluster, press control-D to exit...
    >>>


Test that you have a working step 1:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /home/vagrant/teuthology
    source virtualenv/bin/activate
    grep -o "^.*\.front\.sepia\.ceph\.com" archive/info.yaml |\
        xargs -I'{}' ssh '{}' "if [ -e /etc/ceph/ceph.client.0.keyring ]; then ceph health; fi"


Step 2: Testing setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few manual changes you'll need to make to test against this cluster:

- Add a master_fqdn dict to teuthology/archive/info.yaml like:

.. code-block:: yaml

    master_fqdn:
        <FQDN, including port (:8000 by default), of the calamari devmode instance>
	myhost.example.com:8000

- Edit tests/test.conf changing ceph_control under testing to 'external'

.. code-block:: yaml

    [testing]
        ceph_control = external

- set cluster_distro to 'ubuntu' or 'rhel' (the closest one to the distro
  you're actually running on the cluster)

- Make sure you have the repositories setup so that bootstrap can succeed TODO

.. _kickoff-tests:

Step 2: Kickoff tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    # TODO this will be connected up in http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/7812
    cd calamari
    source env/bin/activate
    nosetests tests/


.. _teardown:

Step 3: Teardown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hit Ctrl-D in the teuthology session

.. code-block:: bash

    # Please replace calamari@inktank.com with your email address
    cd /home/vagrant/teuthology
    source virtualenv/bin/activate
    teuthology-lock --list-targets --owner calamari@inktank.com |\
     teuthology-nuke -t /dev/stdin -u --owner=calamari@inktank.com

.. _troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you see something like this try running the code in :ref:`teardown`

.. code-block:: bash

    INFO:teuthology.run:Summary data:
    {description: calamari devmode test target, failure_reason: 'Stale jobs detected,
        aborting.', owner: calamari@inktank.com, success: false}


{description: calamari devmode test target, failure_reason: not enough machines are
    available, owner: calamari@inktank.com, success: false}

WARNING: This should only be performed on machines you have locked previously.

.. code-block:: bash

  1 #!/bin/bash
  2
  3 set -x
  4 set -e
  5
  6 for host in $@
  7 do
  8     ssh ubuntu@plana01.front.sepia.ceph.com "sudo cobbler system edit --name=${host} --netboot on"
  9     /usr/local/bin/ipmitool -H ${host}.ipmi.sepia.ceph.com -I lanplus -U inktank -P ApGNXcA7 power reset
 10 done;

you can add a â€”profile argument to the cobbler command to select distro
and do a "sudo cobbler profile list" on plana01 to see what's available


Testing to validate a packaged installation
-------------------------------------------

In this section we'll explore a method to run the test suite against external ceph and calamari.
This  is useful for checking the sanity of a cluster and calamari that are running external to the development environment.

WARNING
^^^^^^^

Do not run this procedure on any instances of ceph or calamari that have data you care about.
The tests delete all non-default pools.
Running this against a cluster will mean certain data loss.

Theory of operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This test suite can manipulate the state of calamari and ceph-clusters in a rudimentary fashion.
It can be configured to control instances of each. We say that packages are good If this suite passes against calamari and ceph
that was provisioned using those packages.

Assumptions and prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setup an instance of calamari and a ceph cluster that are connected. see :ref:`building-the-cluster`

An instance of devmode running e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    calamari/vagrant/devmode $ vagrant up


Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In devmode:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir ~/teuthology/archive
    echo '''master_fqdn:
        <FQDN of your calamari instance>

    cluster:
        <user@FQDN of ceph mon>
                roles:
                - mon.1
                - osd.1
                - client.0
        <user@FQDN of ceph mon>
                roles:
                - mon.1
                - osd.1
                - client.0
    ''' > ~/teuthology/archive/info.yaml
    # Be sure to include one cluster entry for each monitor node


.. code-block:: bash

    echo '''[testing]

    calamari_control = external
    ceph_control = external

    api_url = http://<FQDN of your calamari instance>/api/v2/
    api_username = admin
    api_password = admin

    embedded_timeout_factor = 1
    external_timeout_factor = 3

    external_cluster_path = /home/vagrant/calamari/../teuthology/archive/info.yaml
    ''' > ~/calamari/tests/test.conf


Running the tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

see :ref:`kickoff-tests`


Unit tests
----------

On a module by module basis, in tests/ within a module.  For example, in ``cthulhu``:

.. code-block:: bash

    calamari $  nosetests cthulhu/tests
    ........
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 8 tests in 0.288s

    OK
