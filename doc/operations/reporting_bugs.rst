Reporting Issues
================

The Calamari issue tracker is at http://tracker.ceph.com/projects/calamari

.. note::

    These instructions are for community users.  If you are an Inktank Ceph Enterprise
    customer, please contact support directly via the same channels you would
    use for Ceph issues.

Before opening an issue, please gather all available diagnostic information, especially 
the log files from the Calamari server.  The Calamari server logs are stored in
``/var/log/calamari``.

Please ensure that you mention which versions of Calamari and Ceph you are using,
how you built or obtained packages, and the name and version of the Linux
distribution you are using.

If you are reporting an issue involving the user interface, please include screenshots
of the relevant parts.  If the user interface appears to be exhibiting a bug itself,
please check the Javascript console in your web browser for error messages and
include these as well.  Please mention the name and version of the web browser you
are using.
